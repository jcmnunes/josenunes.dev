  Interactive rebase is a powerful tool to rewrite Git history and maintain a
  sane commit history.
---

In this post, I would like to touch some Git related topics. The first topic is
GitFlow. GitFlow is a branching model for Git, created by
[Vincent Driessen](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). In
GitFlow, besides the two main branches, `master` and `develop`, we can have
three types of supporting branches:

- Feature
- Release
- Hotfix

I want to focus, for now, on the workflow regarding Feature branches. As the
name implies, they are used to develop new features ðŸ¤”. When doing so, it is not
uncommon to start making commits with both sloppy commit messages and code. I
think that is perfectly ok as long as we later clean the mess. My preferred way
of doing so is with an
[interactive rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History).
The command I use most often is:

```bash
$ git rebase -i develop
```

**Note**: it is also possible to rebase just the previous N commits by running:

```bash
$ git rebase -i HEAD~N
```

Interactive rebase is a powerful tool. There is a lot we can do with it. In most
cases, I use it to squash all the previous commits into a large commit with a
structured commit message. To give an example, let's consider a hypothetical
feature implementation.

Let's imagine we have a ticket to modify our app to point the user into this
blog post. Let's also imagine the change needs to be made in the following
component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Hero = () => (
  <div>
    <p>
      Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
    </p>
    <a
      className="App-link"
      href="https://reactjs.org"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      Learn React
    </a>
  </div>
);

export default Hero;
```

We may start by changing the text in the p tag:

```jsx{5}
import React from 'react';

const Hero = () => (
  <div>
    <p>I have a new blog post.</p>
    <a
      className="App-link"
      href="https://reactjs.org"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      Learn React
    </a>
  </div>
);

export default Hero;
```

Let's commit the change:

```bash
$ git commit -am "New pre-link text"
```

Now, we need to change the URL of the link:

```jsx{8}
import React from 'react';

const Hero = () => (
  <div>
    <p>I have a new blog post.</p>
    <a
      className="App-link"
      href="https://josenunes.xyz/blog/thoughts-git"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      Learn React
    </a>
  </div>
);

export default Hero;
```

We commit the new change:

```bash
$ git commit -am "New link URL"
```

Finally, we need to change the link text:

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Hero = () => (
  <div>
    <p>I have a new blog post.</p>
    <a
      className="App-link"
      href="https://josenunes.xyz/blog/git-i-rebase"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
    >
      Read it here
    </a>
  </div>
);

export default Hero;
```

We commit the new change:

```bash
$ git commit -am "New link text"
```

If we check the history now, we can see three commits associated with the
feature we are implementing. However, all of them have relatively weak commit
messages. Also, there is not a great value in having all those separate commits
laying around. In situations like these, I tend to use an interactive rebase to
squash all the commits and to give this new commit a proper commit message. The
command I use often is:

```bash
$ git rebase -i develop
```

Which results in:

```git
pick b2e19af New pre-link text
pick 857153b New link URL
pick 8b2be25 New link text

# Rebase 09b0d2e..8b2be25 onto 09b0d2e (3 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop = remove commit
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
```

What I do next is to change the last two commands to be "squash" instead of
"pick". As a pro-tip, in Vim, there is an easy way to do that. Place the cursor
at the beginning of each pick and type `cw`. Vim will delete the word "pick" and
enter "Insert" mode. From there, we need to type a character "s". The final
result should be:

```git{2-3}
pick b2e19af New pre-link text
s 857153b New link URL
s 8b2be25 New link text

# Rebase 09b0d2e..8b2be25 onto 09b0d2e (3 commands)
#
# Commands:
# p, pick = use commit
# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
# f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
# d, drop = remove commit
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out
```

After saving the changes (":wq" in Vim land) we enter a second screen:

```git
# This is a combination of 3 commits.
# This is the 1st commit message:

New pre-link text

# This is the commit message #2:

New link URL

# This is the commit message #3:

New link text

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Thu May 23 14:59:51 2019 +0100
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto 09b0d2e
# Last commands done (3 commands done):
#    s 857153b New link URL
#    s 8b2be25 New link text
# No commands remaining.
# You are currently rebasing branch 'feature/TST-1_new-blog-post-link' on '09b0d2e'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       new file:   src/Hero.js
#
```

Here, what I usually do is to delete some lines (I use Vim's "dd" command for
that) and leave just the commit messages as follows:

```git{1-8}
Add link to new blog post
#
Changes:
- New pre-link text
- New link URL
- New link text
#
TST-1
# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# Date:      Thu May 23 14:59:51 2019 +0100
#
# interactive rebase in progress; onto 09b0d2e
# Last commands done (3 commands done):
#    s 857153b New link URL
#    s 8b2be25 New link text
# No commands remaining.
# You are currently rebasing branch 'feature/TST-1_new-blog-post-link' on '09b0d2e'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       new file:   src/Hero.js
#
```

As we can see, the previous commit messages are used to discriminate the several
changes we did while implementing the feature, but instead of having a bunch of
commits we now have one global commit with a solid commit message. Notice also,
that on the last line I usually type the Jira code (TST-1 in this example).

Saving and quitting (":wq") will conduct the rebase. Now, it is a good time to
open a pull-request (PR). Another benefit of this workflow, is now, the PR title
and description will be automatically filled for us, which depending on the
project we are working on, could be just enough to describe our PR.

Of course, there is a lot more we can do while rebasing a feature branch.
Depending on the commit history we might want to rename commits or remove them
altogether.
