  In this first post, I talk a bit about this website and its design process.

Welcome to josenunes.dev blog. For a long time, I've been thinking about writing
a personal blog. Although that was something I wanted for a long time, I never
had the proper commitment to start building it. Over the years, I made several
attempts that never got too far.

My first serious attempt was in 2016, when inspired by a recent design I worked
on at the time ([this website âžœ](http://exchange.ics.uminho.pt/)), I went for a
full page layout.

I spent some time designing new ideas for that first version of the website. One
of those was a cool UI to review some of the mac apps I use.

## Version 2

As usual, even considering the time spent designing several screens, I ended up
abandoning the project. It was not until later, in 2018, that I decided to give
it another try. This time, I decided to search for a ready-made template online.
I found
[this one](https://themeforest.net/item/profyl-personal-vcard-resume-html-template/20952362)
from iconic themes.

However, I soon start tackling the design. I ended up designing several screens.
The first change I made was to introduce a dark theme. Later, I redesigned the
homepage to suit my personal preference.

Again, I started thinking about new (crazy) ideas. A good example was the idea
of using a GitGraph to represent my professional record.

## Version 3

Version 3 is the current version of the website. As can be seen from the
previous two images, it shares the same color scheme and dark theme of
version 2. The big difference is the "personality" of the design. The current
version has (at least from my perspective) a "coder personality". The dark
theme, combined with a monospace font, and a more text-based design, are the
factors responsible for it.

And finally, I have a personal website/blog ðŸŽ‰. Thank you for checking it!
